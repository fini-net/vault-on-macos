# vault-on-macos
Vault on MacOS without dev server mode

## Decision to Abandon Project

Considering Hashicorp's recent decision to not participate in the open source or free
software movements I don't think it will be beneficial to contribute improvements,
such as this project.  I'm sure they would be happy to pay for an engineer to build this.
The only way that would happen is if one of the product managers felt like it would
be an improvemenet for the product, so I'm not holding my breath.

## Original Motivation

The Hashicorp vault formulae included with homebrew creates a MacOS service for vault.
Sadly this service is running in dev mode and doesn't provide a basis for building
something potentially production-worthy.
